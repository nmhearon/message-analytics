# My Message and Analytics
## Introduction
For this project we were asked to curate a message that we would like to share with the world, and then to utilize all of the technologies that we have worked with this semester to construct a website in order to share that message.  The ultimate goal of this project is to introduce the use of google analytics into our websites in order to track how far our content reaches, as well as what demographics we are reaching.
